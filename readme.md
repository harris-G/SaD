## ✨ Highlights <a name="highlights"></a>

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dual-View Learning** | Jointly leverages a *sparse* SLIM neighbourhood view and a *dense* GCN embedding view. |
| **Plug-and-Play** | Drop-in module for **LightGCN**, **SimGCL**, **UltraGCN**, etc. — *one line* to boost long-tail recall. |
| **Theory-Practice Bridged** | Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis, validated empirically. |
